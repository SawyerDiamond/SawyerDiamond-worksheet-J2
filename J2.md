**1 ) Which of the following is an object and which is a basic type?**
The string is the object, while the integer, double, and array are basic types.

**2 ) Two part question:**

_(A) What is a static method in Java?_
Static methods operate on class data, not objects. 

_(B) Why does the main method need to be a static method?_
So there is no ambiguity as to which constructor would be called, as it wouldn't make sense for the main component of the program 
to be an instance of an object. 

**3) What is the output of the following programs?**
Program 1: Wrong
Program 2: Correct

**4) Does the below program change the season? Why, or why not?**
No, the program does not change the season, an assignment inside a method to a new object breaks the connection, meaning the 
original instance is not overwritten.

**5) What is the output of the main method below? Please explain.**
X: 0
Y: 0

X, Y are local variables within main, if the code was changed to this.(x/y) = x/y then the intended values would print, as it would call on the 
local variables of 1,2, rather than the instance variables of 0,0.

**6) What principle of OOP does the private declaration for variable and functions achieve? Explain.**
Controls what outside of the class has access to the instance of an object.

**7) In the Point class below, how does Java choose between the two constructors.**
Java can differentiate based on the arguments passed in the case of method overloading, where if two doubles are passed, 
Java will utilize the first constructor. Alternatively, if any other type of argument is passed, Java will attempt to use the second Point constructor. 

**8) For the below questions, when the class Point is referenced, we are talking about the below class, which you can assume is
fully implemented and working as described:**
Option 4 would be the working choice, as new variables are declared, and all methods called are public. 

**9) If we add this constructor to CustomPoint: â€¦and then run this program, what is the output?**
Won't compile, as calls to super should be the first line in a constructor, similar to .this(). 

**10) What if we switch line 1 and 2 in the previous question?**
The code will compile and function as intended (in this case the order is flipped though)

**11) If we want to override sum_x_y in our custom point, but first reflect the point before returning the sum, 
which of the following implementations are valid? (Note: assume that reflect has a valid implementation)**

Option 2 is the only one that succesfully overrides sum_x_y with the intended functionality and returns the correct value.
